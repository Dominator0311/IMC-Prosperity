# Round 3 Local Artifact Inventory

Date: 2026-04-26

This repo intentionally keeps large generated Round 3 research outputs on disk
but out of git history. The artifacts are ignored by `.gitignore` under
`outputs/round_3/**` and are preserved locally in:

- Main workspace: `/Users/abhinavgupta/Desktop/IMC/outputs/round_3/`
- Velvet worktree backup: `/Users/abhinavgupta/Desktop/IMC-r3-velvet-options/`

The Velvet worktree was not deleted. At the time of this inventory it remains
registered as a git worktree on branch `codex/r3-velvet-options`.

## Committed Artifacts

These are small or strategically important enough to keep in git:

- `data/raw/round_3/` — raw Round 3 price/trade CSVs and the round image.
- `docs/round_3/` — research notes, postmortems, memory docs, and transcripts.
- `src/scripts/round_3/` — Hydrogel and Velvet research runners.
- `src/engines/r3_velvet_options_engine.py`
- `src/engines/r3_velvet_options_factory.py`
- `src/strategies/round_3/velvet_options_rolling_iv.py`
- `outputs/submissions/submission_r3*.py` — upload candidates and final bundles.

## Cleanup Rule

Do not delete local-only outputs until either:

1. the important summaries have been promoted into `docs/round_3/`, or
2. a compressed external archive has been created and verified.

The current cleanup keeps them in place and only removes them from git status.
