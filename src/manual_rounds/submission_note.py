"""Structured submission-note builder.

Every manual-round answer must pass the validation protocol in
``docs/tutorial/manual_strategy_plan.md``: chosen answer, core assumptions,
backup answer, biggest risk. This module renders that checklist into
a markdown note that can be pasted into the team's notes folder or the
submission confirmation dialog.

Deliberately small and side-effect-free: the note is returned as a
string. Callers decide where to write it (usually
``outputs/notes/round_N_manual.md``).
