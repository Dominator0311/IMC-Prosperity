"""CounterpartyIntelligenceEngine (E4) — track + classify counterparties.

Runs across ALL products from R3 tick 0. Hidden-alpha top-1 finding:
Olivia-class informed bots are detectable from R1 via P&L clustering +
behavior fingerprint, a ~200k head start vs R5-reveal-name-match.

Composition:
- PortfolioContext (B): read all products' trade tapes
- SignalBus (C): emit per-counterparty regime tags
- PortfolioRiskManager (B): consume the tags for piggyback sizing

Classification: each counterparty ID gets 5 rolling features:
- cum_pnl (cumulative implied P&L based on entry-vs-exit mid)
- trade_count
- win_rate (fraction of trades that ended in-the-money by N ticks)
- entry_percentile (distribution: 0% = bought at daily low, 100% = at daily high)
- inventory_cycle_amplitude (how much their implied position swings)

3-means classifier over these features produces {informed, MM, noise}:
- Informed: flat-line-up cum_pnl + bimodal entry percentile at 0%/100% + large swings
- MM: cum_pnl near zero + high trade count + narrow entry percentile
- Noise (retail): negative cum_pnl + small volume + random entry percentile

Pre-R5 we only have anonymized hashes of trade patterns, not IDs; the
engine hashes counterparty trade-flow fingerprint so we can "identify"
the same bot across R3/R4 without knowing its name.

Emits a SignalValue per informed counterparty that downstream basket/
options engines can consume for piggyback sizing — NOT for fair-value
skew (F3 warning).
